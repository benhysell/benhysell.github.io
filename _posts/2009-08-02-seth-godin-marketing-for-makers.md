I found this video the other day in my travels along the interwebs and wanted to share with the class.  For me, this was one of those videos I'm going to have to watch a few times to fully appreciate it.  Seth says he is going to move fast through his material when he starts, and he isn't kidding.

Seth explores marketing over the ages and how the game has changed from interruption marketing (TV) to the new world order.  In the past, someone could force you to view their ads on TV (thank you, thank you, thank you TiVo), but now a days there are so many media outlets and products pushing for our attention that we are overwhelmed with stimulus and are never forced to view any marketing from anyone.

It is as if our attention is being attacked by a huge denial of service attack where so much marketing information is coming at us we decide to turn it all off and listen to none of it.

The game has changed, people need to be looking for you to find you, and most marketing and products are not designed this way.  Seth hammers home several points:
<ul>
	<li>Your software should have marketing built in</li>
	<li>Your software should be able to self market</li>
	<li>Your goal is to have people want to use your software, and spread the word about your software to others</li>
</ul>
::cough Apple, cough Google, cough, cough::

Seth’s best example of one company who gets it and one that doesn’t?  Ford vs. BMW.  When was the last time you saw an ad for a BMW?  Can you go three minutes watching TV and not run into a Ford ad?  BMW pours their marketing money into the product, making something people want, and given unlimited resources, something most people would likely buy given the chance.

::That is, of course, until you have to take it to the shop, but I digress::

This is a great video for anyone who makes anything, software or otherwise.

Please to enjoy Seth Godin at the Business of Software 2008.

::After watching this the first time through I thought to myself, '<em>I need to add his blog to my daily reading list</em>'.  Little did I realize I've been reading his blog for some time,  doh, http://sethgodin.typepad.com/::
