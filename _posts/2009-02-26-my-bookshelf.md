I've added two new tabs to the top of my blog, my book shelf and my anti-bookshelf.

I wanted to have a collection of books that I've talked about in my other posts in one place on my blog.  These are books that I actually have sitting on my bookshelf in my office or at home.  I give you my bookshelf:

<a href="http://benjaminhysell.com/my-bookshelf/" target="_blank">http://benjaminhysell.com/my-bookshelf/</a>

I also wanted to provide a place to list books that I have had the misfortune to purchase, and that given the opportunity I would never, ever buy again.  These books also sit on my bookshelf because I don't believe it getting rid of technical books, no matter how bad they are.  I give you my anti-bookshelf:

<a href="http://benjaminhysell.com/my-anti-bookshelf/" target="_blank">http://benjaminhysell.com/my-anti-bookshelf/</a>

I aim to keep these pages up to date with new books as I come across them.
