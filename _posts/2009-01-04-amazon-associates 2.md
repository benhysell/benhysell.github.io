In the spirit of full disclosure, I joined <a href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/">Amazon Associates</a> today.  Amazon Associates advertises on their front page 'Make Money Advertising Amazon Products', they break it down further...'send traffic to Amazon, if someone you send buys what you sent them to buy you get a referral percentage.'

My plans, make millions and millions by hawking all sorts of Amazon products, like

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0671746723?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=benjahysel-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0671746723">Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency</a> by Douglas Adams

::I am a huge Douglas Adams fan, I've read the '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345453743?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=benjahysel-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0345453743">The Trilogy</a>' upwards of 15 times::

If you went and clicked the link, liked what you saw, and ended up buying the book I would get a small percentage of the sale.  A foolproof plan!  I'll have my millions by Wednesday…Thursday at the latest.

:: Insert evil laugh here. ::

Sadly, I don't expect I'll have the number of readers to my site to actually turn this into a money making venture.  However this is a fairly common practice with most bloggers, and I hopped on board with two thoughts:
<ol>
	<li>Once in a while I will reference a book I'm reading right now</li>
	<li>If anyone is actually into one of my suggestions why not leverage Amazon and the referral program?</li>
</ol>
We'll see how it goes...consider yourself fully disclosed.
