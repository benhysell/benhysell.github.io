I have had a busy writing night...

I have added a couple of new books to <a href="http://benjaminhysell.com/my-bookshelf/" target="_blank">my bookshelf</a>, one I finished a few weeks ago and one I'm still reading.  I decided I was going to add these books even though they are not directly related to software, projects, or people.  All work and no play will make Benjamin a very dull boy.

Check them out: <a href="http://benjaminhysell.com/my-bookshelf/" target="_blank">http://benjaminhysell.com/my-bookshelf/</a>
