Shortly after I wrote about my <a href="http://benjaminhysell.com/archive/2009/03/rubber-ducky/" target="_blank">lack of a rubber ducky</a> something strange happened...three rubber duckies showed up on my desk. Â Naturally I gave them all good homes.

The first stayed on my desk at home...

The second is living on my desk at work in a makeshift pond:

The last is living in my car:

Now no matter where I am I have a rubber ducky to talk things over with.

I want to thank my wife Vanessa for the rubber duckies, her continual support, and for taking the time to read my blog.
